## 🧠 My Approach

1. **Design Analysis & Planning**

   * Carefully analyzed the original page and identified the parts that needed a UI/UX overhaul.
   * Noted issues in responsiveness (especially in the progress navigation) and marked areas for improvement.

2. **AI-Assisted Design & Development**

   * Used **Lovable AI** with a carefully crafted prompt to generate a visually appealing and modern design.
   * Utilized **Claude 4 AI** to assist in resolving responsiveness issues and generate optimized component structures.
   * AI tools also supported **code generation**, reducing development time and improving consistency.

3. **Development & Data Integration**

   * Rebuilt the UI using **React + TypeScript** with **reusable components** for maintainability.
   * Fetched skip options using **Axios** and **React Query** for efficient and reliable data management.
   * Applied **Tailwind CSS** and **ShadCN UI** for clean, responsive, and consistent design.

4. **Performance Optimization**

   * Applied `useCallback`, `useMemo`, and other React optimization techniques to avoid unnecessary re-renders and improve overall performance.

5. **Final Testing & Verification**

   * Ensured the redesigned page was fully functional and responsive on various screen sizes.
   * Verified that all original behaviors and functionality remained intact after the redesign.
